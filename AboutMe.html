                <p>Hello, my name is Adair.</p><br>
                <p>I love all things web. My driving passion is to succeed in making every web project I'm faced with function as beautifully as it looks. Known as an innovative thinker and useful collaborator, developing apps both individually and on a team comes easily to me and every development project is accompanied by a of drive for success.</p><br>
                <p> I am a fast learner and forward thinker when approaching projects, aiming to effortlessly meet deadlines, collaborate efficiently, and achieve the best outcome I am capable of with user experience and optimal coding practices in mind. I am always looking forward to my next project to improve my skills and see what more I can create.</p><br>
                <p>I am currently attending a coding bootcamp to get a more professional understanding of web development concepts. My goal for this bootcamp is to have a thorough grasp on both front-end and back-end development confidently enough to excel in beginning my career.</p>

            <p>I am originally from St. Paul, Minnesota but am currently living in Charlotte, North Carolina where I enjoy the company of my partner and our four pets. Spending time outside is one of my favorite pastimes, especially when it means I'm hiking up a mountain or exploring a new greenway.</p><br>
            <p>I'm also a big fan of video games, music, and film. Any form of art I have been met with has always been a big part of my life, web development included!</p><br>
